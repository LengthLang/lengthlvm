Somebody once told me the
world is
gonna roll m
e. I ain't the sharpest t
o
ol in the\
shed. She was lookin
kinda dumb w
ith her finger a
nd her thumb in the shape
of an L on her forehead. Well
the years\
start coming
and they don't s
top coming... fed to the\
rules a
nd I hit t
he ground ru
nning. Didnt
make sense not t
o live for fun.\
Your brain gets smart, bu
t y
our head g
ets dumb. So muc
h to do, so much to see,\
so what's w
rong with taking the back
stre
ets? You never know\
if you don't
go. You neve
r shine if you d
on't glow. Hey now, your'
e an all sta
r, get your
game on, go play
. Hey now, y
our'e a ro
ckstar, get the show on,\
g
et paid. Al
l that glitt
ers is gold. Onl
y shooting stars break th
e mould. It's a cool pla
ce and the
y say it get
s colder. You're
bundled up now, wait till
you
get older.
But the medi
a men beg to dif
fer, judging by the hole\
in the
satellite p
icture. The\
ice we skate is\
getting pretty thin. The\
water's\
getting war
m, so you might\
as well swim. My world's\
on fire, how about yours? Thats t
he way I like it
